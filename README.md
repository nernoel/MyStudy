# StudyWithMe
<p>Study with me is a student collaborative application where students are able to find a study partner. The goal is that students will always have someone to study with when needed and can post to find someone who they can study with!</p>

# 🛠️ Bugs and future updates
The app currently needs some UI fixes and polishes to the UI & UX design, and am currently working on those. All functionality is working but would like to include more features such as more user authentication options (currently limited to Google auth).

# 📺 Demo
Demo is coming soon...
